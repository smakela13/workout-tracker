# Workout Tracker

## Description

Do you want to get in shape and live a healthier life?

This workout tracker will allow you to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You can view up to seven days worth of workouts. You can track your resistance and cardio exercises, too. All you need to do is track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration. If you're doing cardio, then you'll also be given the ability to track distance traveled. Weight, sets, reps, and distance are optional entries in case you do or don't need them.

Get ready to be in the best shape of your life!

This workout tracker was written in JavaScript using Express.js, Mongoose, Node.js, MongoDB Atlas, HTML, and CSS. It's deployed on Heroku.
